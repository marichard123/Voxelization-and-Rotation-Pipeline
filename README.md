# Voxelization-and-Rotation-Pipeline
Files written during URAP Fall 2022 undergraduate research to write and manipulate .stl and .binvox files

This repository makes use of a modified version of [binvox-rw.py](https://github.com/dimatura/binvox-rw-py), written by Daniel Maturana. binvox-rw.py is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3, and as such the same free licensing conditions apply to this repository. The files make heavy use of [binvox.exe](https://www.patrickmin.com/binvox), written by Patrick Min.

## How to use it
To download and make use of the pipeline, the entire Voxelization-and-Rotation-Pipeline repository should be downloaded as a zip file and unzipped. Once installed, there are only two steps to using the pipeline:

1). **The STL files to be voxelized and rotated should be moved inside a folder called 'stl_repository', which is to be located inside the Voxelization-and-Rotation-Pipeline directory.** A zipped 'stl_repository' folder is included, with several sample STL files inside of it. Once unzipped, the pipeline is ready to run, and STL files may be added to the 'stl_repository' folder as desired. Alternatively, a pathway to an alternative pipeline of a different name may be specifiedâ€”the next step will describe this process.

2). **The 'voxelization_rotation_user_interface.m' MatLab file should be run. By default, the user will be prompted to confirm his or her decision to delete the rotated and voxelized files generated by previous runs. No further action or manipulation is required.** By default, the pipeline will read files from a folder called 'stl_repository' located in the same directory, and will delete the result of previous runs. These conditions may be changed in lines 3 and 2 of 'voxelization_rotation_user_interface.m', respetively. In line 4, the user may choose whether to voxelize to both default and 64^3 dimension (default_dimension_only = false;), or whether to voxelized to only deafult dimension (default_dimension_only = false;).

The results of the pipeline's calcaultions will be stored in the newly generated folders of 'Binvox_files_64_res', 'Binvox_files_default_res', and 'rotated_files'.
